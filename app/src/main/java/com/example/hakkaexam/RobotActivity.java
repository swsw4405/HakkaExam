     * following call to {@link #onStop} (after the next activity has been resumed and displayed
     * above). However in some cases there will be a direct call back to {@link #onResume} without
     * going through the stopped state. An activity can also rest in paused state in some cases when
     * in multi-window mode, still visible to user.
